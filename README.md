# Learning machine learning

In this repository will be added exercises, practices and theory about machine learning and deep learning.

For a better understanding, the Jupyter environment will be used, which allows step-by-step execution of the program by adding theory.

## Installation

### Jupyter Notebook

If you have Python 3 installed (which is recommended):

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

To run Jupyter Lab, type:

```bash
pip3 install jupyter lab
jupyter lab
```

To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (*Mac/Linux*) or Command Prompt (*Windows*):

```
jupyter notebook
```
